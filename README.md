# 16S RNA-sequencing analysis

## Basic terms

* Metagenomics: 
Is the study of DNA total extracted from an environment sample or series of related samples without the selection of specific organisms.
However, metagenomics primarily focus on the analysis of communities of bacteria in one environment like soil and colon.
Hence, community composition refers primarily to study bacteria and archaeal species. Community composition analysis is employed at several stages of the metagenomics study workflow.

Community complexity is based on:

- Richness → Number of species in the community.
- Evenness → Relative abundance of each species in the community.

* Alpha diversity:
  Measure of biodiversity within a specific local or well-defined area
* Beta diversity:
  Estimates of similarity or dissimilarity between populations
* 16s rRNA sequencing:
Is a culture-free method to identify and compare bacterial diversity from complex microbiomes or environments that are difficult to study

## Objetive of the course:

In this part of the course we analyze the bacteria diversity of a subset of samples from the Early Childhood Antibiotics and the Microbiome (ECAM) study (Bokulich, Chung, et al., 2016).
